User-centered design process
  - **Understand** how the user experiences the product or similar products. You want to know how users will engage with your design, as well as the environment or context in which they’ll experience the product. Understanding this requires a lot of research, like observing users in action and conducting interviews, which we’ll explore more later.
  - **Specify** the user’s needs. Based on your research, figure out which user problems are the most important to solve. 
  - **Design** solutions to those user problems. Come up with lots of ideas for designs that can address the user problems you’ve identified. Then, start to actually design those ideas! 
  - **Evaluate** the solutions you designed against the user’s needs. Ask yourself, “Does the design I created solve the user’s problem?” To answer this question, you should test the product you designed with real people and collect feedback. 
The five elements of UX design
  - **Strategy**: The bottom layer is strategy, where you lay a foundation of your design goals. These goals are based on user needs and the business objectives for the product.
  - **Scope**: The next layer is scope, where you determine the type of product you’re building. At this point, you will consider the kind of features and content you want to include in the product.
  - **Structure**: The middle layer is structure. Here, you’ll figure out how to organize your design and how you want users to interact with the product.
  - **Skeleton**: The skeleton is the layout of the product. Just like the layout of our bones shapes our skin, the skeleton layer details how your design works – and like a skeleton, users won’t directly see its inner-workings. 
  - **Surface**: The top layer, surface, represents how the product looks to the user. The surface represents the interface that users view and interact with. Think of the surface like the clothes or makeup you wear that are visible to the outside world.
Design thinking process
  - During the **empathize** phase, the goal is to understand users’ needs and how users think and feel. This involves a lot of user research, such as conducting surveys, interviews, and observation sessions, so you can get a clear picture of who your users are and the challenges they are facing.
  - In the **define** phase, you’ll create a clear problem statement, or a description of the user’s need that your designs will address, based on your research findings. This will drive your team toward a clear goal for the design of the product.
  - Once you land on a user problem and establish why it’s an important one to solve, it’s time for the **ideate** phase. The goal of ideation is to come up with as many design solutions as possible. 
  - Once you have an idea of how to solve the problem, you’re ready to enter the **prototype** phase. A prototype is an early model of a product that demonstrates its functionality. 
  - During the **test** phase, users provide feedback about your designs, before the product is built by engineers and launched to the public. You can use this feedback to make changes and improvements to your designs, as many times as you need.
